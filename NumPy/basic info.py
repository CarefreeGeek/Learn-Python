# NumPy is a Python library.
# NumPy is used for working with arrays.
# NumPy is short for "Numerical Python".


# » wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays.

# » It supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that
# operate on these arrays and matrices.

# » mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, 1/0,
# discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical
# operations, random simulation and much more.


# diff b/w np.array and list
# * Data types storage 
# » Importing module
# » Numerical operation
# » Modification capabilities
# » Consumes less memory
# » Fast as compared to the python list
# » Convenient to use
